## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Cached Remote File you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

```sh
dart pub add cached_remote_file
```

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Cached Remote File comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests üß™

For first time users, install the [very_good_cli][very_good_cli_link]:

dart pub global activate very_good_cli
```

To run all unit tests:
